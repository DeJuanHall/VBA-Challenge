# VBA-Challenge
VBA Homework Repo
for our VBS project, we are asked to use VBA scripting to analyze stock market data from 2014 to 2016. Using VBA to do so was a struggle at first, getting the code into to correct order, to enable the looping through 3 Excel worksheets, for various calculations.  The base of the assignement was to calculate yearly changes of various stock opening and closing prices, the yearly percent changes, and the total volume of each stocl. As a bonus, we created a summary of  which stocks had the greatest percent increase, the greatest percent decrease, and the great total volume for each of the 3 years.
